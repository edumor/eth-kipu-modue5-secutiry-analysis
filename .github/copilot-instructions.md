# ETH-KIPU Module 5 Security Analysis Project

## Project Context
This is a smart contract security analysis project for Eduardo Moreno's ETH-KIPU Module 5 practical work. The project focuses on:

1. **Security Vulnerability Analysis** of the Grader5 contract
2. **Smart Contract Development** following Solidity best practices
3. **Deployment to Sepolia Testnet** without verification
4. **Documentation** using NatSpec format in English

## Code Guidelines
- Use **NatSpec documentation** for all contracts, functions, and parameters in English
- Follow **Solidity best practices** and security patterns
- All error messages and strings should be in English
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Implement proper access control and security measures

## Target Contract Analysis
The target contract `Grader5` at `0x5733eE985e22eFF46F595376d79e31413b1A1e16` contains vulnerabilities that need to be identified and exploited ethically for educational purposes.

## Deployment Requirements
- Deploy to Sepolia testnet
- **DO NOT VERIFY** the contract on Etherscan (as per assignment requirements)
- Document all transaction hashes and contract addresses
- Estimate gas consumption for all operations
